### Hello, I'm Robert
While I spent the beginning of my life in central Pennsylvania and upstate New York, I moved to Seattle in 2013 where I currently live with my husband, son, and two cats. I hold a B.S. in Information Technology with a minor in Business Administration from the [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://rit.edu/).

Iâ€™ve worked in the Salesforce ecosystem for more than a decade, most recently as a Lead Member of Technical Staff on the Education Cloud at [Salesforce.org](http://salesforce.org/). Previously, I worked as a senior software developer at [Full Circle Insights](http://fullcircleinsights.com/) and as a software engineer on the Nimble AMS product team at [NimbleUser](http://nimbleuser.com/). I'm a published [Pluralsight author](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/robert-watson) and an active member of the [Trailblazer Community](https://trailblazer.me/id/bobby-watson).

In my free time, I enjoy running, boxing, biking, reading, traveling, and spending time with my family.
