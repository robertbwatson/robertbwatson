### Hello, I'm Robert
While I spent the beginning of my life in central Pennsylvania, I've lived with my husband on the west coast in Seattle since 2013. I hold a B.S. in Information Technology with a minor in Business Administration from the [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://rit.edu/).

I've worked in the Salesforce ecosystem for more than a decade, and I'm currently a Lead Member of Technical Staff on the Education Cloud at [Salesforce.org](http://salesforce.org/). Previously, I worked as a senior software developer at [Full Circle Insights](http://fullcircleinsights.com/) and as a software engineer on the Nimble AMS product team at [NimbleUser](http://nimbleuser.com/). I'm a published [Pluralsight author](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/robert-watson) and an active member of the [Trailblazer Community](https://trailblazer.me/id/bobby-watson).

In my free time, I enjoy running, boxing, biking, reading, traveling, and spending time with our two cats, Panda and Jaws. I survive with coffee and by sleeping in on Sundays.
