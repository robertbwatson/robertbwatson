### Hello, I'm Robert
While I spent the beginning of my life in central Pennsylvania and upstate New York, I moved to Seattle in 2013 where I currently live with my husband, son, and two cats. I hold a B.S. in Information Technology with a minor in Business Administration from the [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://rit.edu/).

I've worked in the Salesforce ecosystem for more than a decade, most recently as a Lead Member of Technical Staff on the Education Cloud team at [Salesforce.org](http://salesforce.org/). Previously, I worked as a senior software developer at [Full Circle Insights](http://fullcircleinsights.com/) and as a software engineer on the Nimble AMS product team at [NimbleUser](http://nimbleuser.com/). I'm also a cofounder of [Adams American Capital](http://adamsamericancapital.com/), a self-funded LLC that invests in real estate ventures, crowdfunding startups, and other high-risk small business endeavors.

In my free time, I enjoy running, boxing, biking, reading, traveling, and spending time with my family.
