### Hello, I'm Robert
While I spent the beginning of my life in central Pennsylvania and upstate New York, I moved to Seattle in 2013 where I currently live with my husband, son, and two cats. I hold a B.S. in Information Technology with a minor in Business Administration from the [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://rit.edu/).

I've worked in the Salesforce ecosystem for over 13 years, and I'm currently the Founder and Principal Technical Consultant at [Soaring Peaks Consulting](https://soaringpeaksconsulting.com/). Before starting my own business, I was a lead engineer on the Education Cloud team at [Salesforce.org](http://salesforce.org/). I've also worked as a senior software developer at [Full Circle Insights](http://fullcircleinsights.com/) and as a software engineer on the Nimble AMS product team at [NimbleUser](http://nimbleuser.com/).

In my free time, you can often find me out running on the trails around the Pacific Northwest or spending time with my family.
